# ZMK Config

This repo contains the [ZMK firmware](https://zmk.dev) configuration files for my [Corne keyboard](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd/), which I purchased from the amazing people at [Typeractive](https://typeractive.xyz/). The keyboard layout is heavily inspired by [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) with very minor modifications. To deepen my understanding of ZMK, I recreated most of Miryoku's features from scratch, with help from the [ZMK Discord community](https://zmk.dev/community/discord/invite) and Nick Coutsos' awesome [keymap editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/). For those new to ZMK, I highly recommend checking out the keymap editor.

## Keymap Features

- Colemak-DH keyboard layout

	I switched from QWERTY to [Colemak-DH](https://colemakmods.github.io/mod-dh/) in October 2023 for better typing ergonomics. So far, the change has been worth the effort, and it's what I have as the default keyboard layout.

- Numbers & symbols on base layer

	Since the Corne does not have a dedicated number row, unlike the popular [58-key Lily58](https://github.com/kata0510/Lily58), I've implemented [combo keys](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/combos) on the base [layer](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/keymaps#layers) for quick access to numbers and symbols. The same numbers & symbols are also available on separate layers.

- Caps word & caps lock
 
 	The [Caps word](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/caps-word) key, located on the left middle edge, triggers caps lock for a single word. This comes in handy when typing environment variables (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=123`), short acronyms (`SQL`, `HTML`, `API`, `NASA`, etc.), and editing constant variables at work like `WARNING_CHANGING_THIS_VARIABLE_MAY_CAUSE_CATASTROPHIC_FAILURE_IN_PRODUCTION = 1` :^)

 	There's also an option to toggle the traditional caps lock behavior by pressing `shift` + `caps word`.

 - Sticky shift & sticky hyper

	The [Sticky shift](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/sticky-key) key, located on the bottom left corner, keeps the shift key pressed until another key is pressed or the 2-second timer elapses (configurable), whichever comes first. It can also be manually toggled off by pressing `sticky shift` again.

	Pressing `shift` + `sticky shift` will activate the Hyper key (`ctrl`+`alt`+`win`+`shift`), which is useful for creating custom keyboard shortcuts that open and switch between frequently used apps. For example, `hyper` + `b` can be used to launch your browser and `hyper` + `e` to switch to your preferred editor. Check out [this tutorial](https://timothymiller.dev/posts/2022/killing-ctrl-tab/) for implementing this on Linux. Also, see [Jumpapp](https://github.com/mkropat/jumpapp) on Linux and [Karabiner-Elements](https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/) on a Mac for mapping the Hyper key to apps.

- Homerow mods

	[Homerow mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods) are powerful and convenient, but can be tricky to set up. I've settled on a comfortable configuration that minimizes accidental modifier key activations.

	```c++
	hrm_l: homerow_mods_left {
				compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";
				label = "HOMEROW_MODS_LEFT_HAND";
				bindings = <&kp>, <&kp>;

				#binding-cells = <2>;
				tapping-term-ms = <200>;
				hold-trigger-key-positions = <6 7 8 9 10 11 18 19 20 21 22 23 30 31 32 33 34 35 39 40 41>;
				flavor = "balanced";
				hold-trigger-on-release;
				quick-tap-ms = <200>;
				require-prior-idle-ms = <125>;
			};

	hrm_r: homerow_mods_right {
				compatible = "zmk,behavior-hold-tap";
				label = "HOMEROW_MODS_RIGHT_HAND";
				bindings = <&kp>, <&kp>;

				#binding-cells = <2>;
				tapping-term-ms = <200>;
				hold-trigger-key-positions = <0 1 2 3 4 5 12 13 14 15 16 17 24 25 26 27 28 29 36 37 38>;
				hold-trigger-on-release;
				flavor = "balanced";
				quick-tap-ms = <200>;
				require-prior-idle-ms = <125>;
			};
	```
	Refer to the [hold-tap](https://zmk.dev/docs/behaviors/hold-tap) docs for detailed explanations of each option.

	In short, if you find yourself accidentally triggering a modifier, consider increasing the tapping term to a range of 200-250ms.
	- `tapping-term-ms = <225>;`.

	or changing the hold-tap flavor to tap-preferred: 
	- `flavor = "tap-preferred";`.

	For additional guidance:

	> The most important tip I can give is to get into the habit of typing with quick, swift taps. The goal is to reduce the time between press and release to the minimum. Donâ€™t focus on pressing keys, but on tapping keys. -- [precondition](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods#quick-swift-taps)

- Extra symbols layer (sym2)

	In addition to Miryoku's stock symbol layer, I've also added an additional symbol layer labeled `sym2`, inspired by Pascal Getreuer's [Designing a Symbol Layer](https://getreuer.info/posts/keyboards/symbol-layer/index.html). However, maintaining the same symbols across multiple layers adds a lot of mental overhead, which is why this extra layer has largely gone unused. I'm still making changes, looking for ways to merge parts of this layer into the main `sym` layer through the use of combo keys. In the future, I plan on replacing this layer with a [mouse emulation](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference#mouse) layer as soon as mouse support is implemented in ZMK.

- Miryoku reference

	The rest of my layout mirrors Miryoku's. Check out the [reference manual](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference) for further details.
